This folder contains analysis scripts used in the paper "Normative evidence weighting and accumulation in correlated environments" by Nathan Tardiff, Jiwon Kang, and Joshua I. Gold.
Now published in eLife: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.100258.2

The data are available at: https://osf.io/qygkc/. 

The analysis code (analysis and DDM fitting) is avalable at at: https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Analysis_Tardiff_Kang_Correlated.

Paths may need to be changed and processed data/model outputs generated in order to run scripts. 


Make sure files in the matlab_dependencies folder are on your matlab path.
