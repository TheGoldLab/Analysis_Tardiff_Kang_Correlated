This folder contains analysis scripts used in the paper "Normative evidence weighting and accumulation in correlated environments" by Nathan Tardiff, Jiwon Kang, and Joshua I. Gold.

The data are available at: https://osf.io/qygkc/. 

The analysis code (analysis and DDM fitting) is avalable at at: https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Analysis_Tardiff_Kang_Correlated.

Paths may need to be changed and processed data/model outputs generated in order to run scripts. 


Make sure files in the matlab_dependencies folder are on your matlab path.
